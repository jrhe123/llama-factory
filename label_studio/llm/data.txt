Below is the correct and safest way to manage account access in GCP and assign a role (e.g., Storage Object Admin / Storage Admin / Owner) to a user email.

✅ How to Grant GCP IAM Access (e.g., Storage Owner) to an Email

GCP manages access through IAM (Identity and Access Management).
To give someone access (e.g., a Gmail or Workspace email), follow these steps:

1. Go to the IAM Page

Open the Google Cloud Console:
https://console.cloud.google.com/

Select your project (top left dropdown).

Go to:
IAM & Admin → IAM

2. Add the User

Click “Grant Access” (top of IAM page)

Enter the email (Gmail, Workspace, service account, etc.)

Choose roles.

3. Select the right Storage role
❗Important: “Storage Owner” is NOT recommended for production

It grants full control over buckets and data, including deletion.

Instead, use:

Common Storage IAM roles
Role	Description
Storage Admin	Manage buckets + all objects (full admin)
Storage Object Admin	Manage objects but not buckets
Storage Object Creator	Write-only
Storage Object Viewer	Read-only
Example for full access to objects:

Role → Storage → Storage Object Admin

4. (Optional) Restrict to a specific bucket

If you don’t want to give project-wide access:

Go to Cloud Storage → Browser

Click the bucket

Go to Permissions

Click Grant Access

Add the same roles at the bucket-level only

5. Save

Click Save and the user will receive an email invitation.

🚨 Notes & Best Practices
1. Use the Principle of Least Privilege

Only give the minimum role required.

2. Avoid giving “Owner”

Use “Owner” only in extreme cases.

3. For applications, use Service Accounts, not personal emails

Service accounts can hold roles without involving humans.

🧪 Example Use Case
📌 If you want your teammate to manage all files in a bucket:

Steps:

IAM → Grant Access

Enter team@example.com

Add role: Storage Object Admin

Done.
